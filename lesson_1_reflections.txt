How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It was easier to locate the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

We can lookback to the changes that we have done from the previous version and fix issues.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

You can commit files related to a single feature together when the feature is completed.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Multiple files can be commited for a common feature or a bug fix and it is better to have these changes togethter

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

We first search the commit message for a feature and then compare the new version with its previous one.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

We could easily revert to the previous commit and create a new branch or fix the issue

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

A new project
